Poll CovidQueue and print the raw results

For some reason, likely due to my convoluted browser setup CovidQueue wasn't
showing me results.

- If you have a TalkBox Account, you can hook it up to you API Triggered comms
  to send SMS alerts.

- I have no idea if the results are valid, accurate, up to date or even what type
  of availability it is.

Have fun; good luck.
