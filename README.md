Poll CovidQueue and print the raw results

For some reason, likely due to my convoluted browser setup CovidQueue wasn't
showing me results.

Heres a scripty-poo that will get the raw data and print it out.

I have no idea if the results are valid, accurate, up to date or even what type
of availability it is.

Have fun; good luck.
